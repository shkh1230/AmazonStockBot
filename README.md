Amazon Stock Bot


The Amazon Stock Bot project, conceived and developed during the HackDFW event, is a comprehensive solution designed to predict stock shortages for high-demand products on the Amazon platform. Leveraging machine learning, web automation, and data visualization technologies, this project offers an innovative approach to address real-world inventory challenges.

Features:

Machine Learning Algorithm: The core of this project revolves around a meticulously designed machine learning algorithm. With a dataset encompassing 50,000 diverse products, the algorithm has been trained to predict stock shortages with an impressive accuracy rate exceeding 90%. The utilization of Python, Pandas, and NumPy ensures robust data manipulation and predictive modeling.

Real-time Data Replication: To simulate real-time data, we've employed Pandas, a powerful data analysis library. This facilitates the algorithm in replicating the dynamic nature of Amazon's inventory data, enabling accurate predictions even as stock levels evolve rapidly.

Web Server and Monitoring: A significant highlight of the project is the implementation of a web server utilizing the Chromium framework. This server offers real-time monitoring capabilities, allowing users to keep track of inventory predictions as they unfold. The integration of Chromium streamlines the web server setup, enhancing the project's accessibility and usability.

Computer Image Recognition: The solution includes computer image recognition, a pivotal aspect of predicting stock shortages. By employing Python's image processing capabilities, we're able to analyze product images and correlate them with historical data, contributing to the algorithm's accuracy.

CI/CD Pipelines: Ensuring the project's reliability and efficiency, we've established Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) testing pipelines. This automation streamlines testing, deployment, and ongoing monitoring of the algorithm, fostering a seamless development cycle.

Contributions and Future Development:
We encourage contributions from the open-source community to further refine and expand the capabilities of the Amazon Stock Bot project. Potential enhancements could include the integration of additional e-commerce platforms, improved machine learning models, and enhanced data visualization.
